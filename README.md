# amzn2-base-ami

A base ami configured from the latest AWS provided Amazon Linux 2 AMI, with additional configuration and security hardening applied.

Intended usage is to provide a hardened, up to date image containing shared configuration and agents that will be present on all Amazon Linux based instances. This will then be used as a common base image to create further use case or application specific AMI's.
